            It all started when Lokesh, in his 4th semester of college, decided
            to start this studio on a whim. With determination, he got the
            company registered and began working with four clients. His success
            in making good connections began with his first internship during
            his first year. The diligent work he demonstrated caught the
            attention of many, leading to more projects and expanding our
            portfolio.

          <p className="aboutSectionText">
            Through his experience working with multiple teams and understanding
            the market, Lokesh realized there was a significant need for a
            top-notch design and development studio. Thus, our journey began,
            driven by a passion for creating exceptional products and delivering
            outstanding services.

            Yes, I'm the guy who crafted this website and penned the story of
            our studio. Online, I'm known as Yonko, and I'm the lead designer
            here at Brutanix. Let me tell you, getting these designs just right
            was a lot of work!

            So, Lokesh came to me for some design advice, and I thought, "Why
            not?" What started as a simple design ended up with me working for a
